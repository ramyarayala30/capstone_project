# 🍔 Food Ordering System 

## 📌 Project Overview
The Food Ordering System is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of ordering food online. It allows users to register, log in, browse available food items, and place orders.

Users can explore different food items, view details such as price and description, and select items based on their preferences. The system enables users to place orders, manage quantities, and track their order history.

The application ensures smooth order processing and maintains records of users, food items, and orders in the database. The goal of this system is to provide a fast, convenient, and user-friendly platform for ordering food online.

# 🤖 Automation Feasibility

Automation feasibility in a Food Ordering System focuses on identifying which parts of the application are stable, repeatable, and suitable for automation.

Functional flows such as login, user registration, fetching the food list, placing an order, and validating order history are ideal candidates for automation because they have fixed steps and predictable outputs.

However, certain areas require manual testing, including UI/UX validation, payment gateway flows involving third-party systems, and visual design verification.

A balanced approach using both automated testing and manual testing ensures better quality and reliability of the system.

# 🧪 Testing Assumptions

- Users must register and log in before accessing the system  
- Only logged-in users can place orders  
- Food items must exist before ordering  
- Orders must contain valid user and food IDs  
- Quantity must be greater than 0  
- Payment is mandatory to confirm an order  
- If payment fails, the order will not be completed  
- System should handle invalid inputs with proper error messages  
- Cancellation and refund follow predefined policies  
- Orders should be stored correctly in the database  
- The test environment (application, database, APIs) should be available and functioning properly
